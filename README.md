# Welcome to Personal Finance Manager

## Project Overview

**Personal Finance Manager** is a project developed for the Software Development course at SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences.
## FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION

## 1. Git

>Use and understand Git! Play with Branches and undo/revert things = go back in time!

&rarr; [See commit history here](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/commits/master)
&rarr; [Second branch + revert/undo](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/commits/InDev#:~:text=Revert%20%22reverse%22,%E2%80%A6)

## 2. UML 

>UML at least 3 good different big diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! Perfect would be 1) one dynamic diagram like an activity diagranm 2) one or two static diagrams as component, class or deployment and if needed a use-case diagram.

## 3. Requirements Engineering

>Describe your project or any project (e.g. one related to your work or a private project) neatly using the methods of Requirements Engineering by mapping some requirements in 2 tools (!).To do this, use the most important description attributes from the script! Approximately 5-10 requirements per tool should be sufficient. Two variants should be provided = tools. A 'self-made' version and a professional = possibly commercial version, i.e. with 2 tools! Examples of 'self-made' variants: Airtable, notion.so, Trello, etc. Examples of commercial tools: Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc. (see Miro). Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself.

|TODO|

## 4. Analysis

>From all the points in the Analysis learning unit, A) come up with your own checklist (on an extra DIN A4 page) with the points that you consider relevant to your project. B. Carry out an analysis of your semester project/your favourite / start-up idea and would like to submit this analysis as part of a large documentary! Write enough about each point to create at least 2 pages. Assume that you will soon have an angel for the start-up chapter. If successful, you would get a lot of “money” to be able to do the design and implement it later. So get your start-up successfully into the race!

|TODO|

## 5. DDD

>DDD Do a DDD session to find your domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >=8 Domains coming from an A) Event Storming. Drop your Domains into a B) Core Domain Chart and draw the C) Relations between the Domains!

## 6. Metrices

>Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.

## 7. Clean Code Dev

>Clean Code Development: A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.

### A
&rarr; [CCD.md](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/master/src/Clean%20Code%20Dev/CCD.md)

&rarr; [PDF Version](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/master/src/Clean%20Code%20Dev/Clean%20Code%20Development.pdf)

&rarr; Reducing amount of code in void main() for better view and creating functions instead

[THEN](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/commit/3653979d2540aaeef5316350c4bf457dc4704d94#:~:text=case%201%3A,successfully.%5Cn%22%3B), [NOW](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/e0e575aad41862babdd12c86c6904b2ca569db1e/src/main.cpp#L189-L211)

Reducing amount of code in switch helped me with organizing space and makes it more readible.

&rarr; [Explanatory variables](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/e0e575aad41862babdd12c86c6904b2ca569db1e/src/main.cpp#L164-L166)

explanatory variables helped me with knowing what should I use. I did not wasted my time searching for "how do I called this variable?", names are clear and uniqe for me. Some people might be a little bit confused with those names but when the will see my POV itt will be easy to use them for everyone

&rarr; [Good comments](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/e0e575aad41862babdd12c86c6904b2ca569db1e/src/PFMLib/FinanceManager.h#L22-L50)

Since my functions are self-explanatory I barely use comments. I mostly use comments to point the most important things to better catch the thing where is something. Also when it will come to the point of big algorithm comments might explain complexity of logic

&rarr; [Error handling](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/e0e575aad41862babdd12c86c6904b2ca569db1e/src/PFMLib/Budgeting.cpp#L26-L34)

Error handling in my case I used for files, sometimes user is unavailable somehow to create file so it is important to know what exactly happendd. 

&rarr; [Intuitive Function names and clear intention of the function/method](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/e0e575aad41862babdd12c86c6904b2ca569db1e/src/main.cpp#L130-L158)

Intuitive function names explains me a lot with what is going on. It helps me plan better and use them by calling the thing what they will be doing. It also helps me find a bug when it comes to unit test because I know which function/funcktions are responsible for it 

### B
Cheat sheet 

&rarr; [CCD_Cheat_Sheet.md](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/master/src/Clean%20Code%20Dev/CCD_Cheat_Sheet.md)

&rarr; [CCD cheat sheet PDF](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/master/src/Clean%20Code%20Dev/Clean%20Code%20Development%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)

## 8. Build

>Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) and CICD

For my build Management I've choosed [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) with is great for C++ code. At first I needed to create file called ```CMakeLists.txt``` to let the tool configure environment. 

![image](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/assets/56294674/4a7bb1d3-23b1-4c43-bd72-3530bd6bed92)

This tool can generate dependencies and building rules as well as linking the libraries directly to IDE. To link the libraries first I needed to configure cmake to be able to configure and uppdate files.

After checking if the configuring is done and every option is marked as white I needed to make sure if the path to source code is correct and then check if the path to build directory is correct. After confirming everything I doublechecked check boxes to verify needed things and clicked Generate.

After generating libraries are ready to use. In my project internal as well as external libraries are included to my project.

## 9. UnitTests

>Integrate some nice unit tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build

To integrate UnitTests for my project I used the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main)

To configure it i needed to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to be able to integrate it with my code. Since at the begining I have not used CMake i needed to rebuild entire project with this tool and specialy preapared the folder called PFMLib to easier integrate test with my Code. Thanks to that PFMLib is now working as a library witch helps me with integrating Google Test with my project. Below you can find a picture of the code as well as file which is mandatory with configurating the tests with the entire project. 

[integration file](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/blob/master/src/UnitTests/CMakeLists.txt)

To run unit test simply open the Personal_Finance_Manager.sln file located [here](https://github.com/gaderiv/SRH-Software-Development-Personal-Finance-Manager/tree/master/build#:~:text=1%20hour%20ago-,Personal_Finance_Manager.sln,-Refactor%20entire%20project) and thanks to that you should have to solutions open. Right-click on the solution to compile it and then press the ```ctrl + e``` followed by ```t``` and run the Unit Tests.

## 10. IDE

>Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!

### CHOSEN IDE: [VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

&rarr; *shortcuts that I used the most*:
- ```ctrl + f``` (find)
- ```ctrl + .``` (creating definition from class to cpp file) 
- ```ctrl + c/v/x``` (copy/paste/cut)
- ```F5/F11/F10``` (debug/step into/step over)  
- ```ctrl + q``` (find functions/Code)

## 11. Functional Programming
>prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
>- only final data structures
>- (mostly) side-effect-free functions
>- the use of higher-order functions
>- functions as parameters and return values
>- use closures / anonymous functions
>- You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
