# Clean Code Development Cheat Sheet

## 1. Meaningful Names
Use function, variable and class names that describe their operation by name, making it easier to navigate through the code. It is important to avoid one-letter names or ambiguous abbreviations

## 2. Comments
Try to write your code to avoid the need to add comments, the code should be largely self-describing. You can use comments to separate specific areas to make it easier to find. If there is a need to use comments, use them to explain non-obvious or complex decisions or logic.
